so i'm having a ton of fun writing about a society in this civ-building game i'm making, consisting of a coalition of pacifist mind-controlling flora and fauna.

> Spore-laden corpses emerge from the fog of battle to negotiate peace during war, while insects domesticated by bacteria whisper utopian thoughts in the ears of warmongers. When sickness turns generals to husks, soldiers say the M'ne Gaana assassinated them.
>
> Imagine a war zone where corpses, civilian and others, rise up from the dead in order to take your weapon and lecture you about violence.
>
> "hey" it utters from bleeding lips "guns are dangerous"
