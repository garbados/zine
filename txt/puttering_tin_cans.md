dreamed i was puttering around the galaxy in a tin can

earth had been destroyed. so we built seed ships to carry humans to other habitable planets. a few light years from earth, our seed ship blew up. my crew represented six survivors of that cataclysm. our tin can was an escape pod, patched countless times to endure our ever-lengthening stay in the void of space. i woke up as we lost two folks to the worm-like inhabitants of a planet we found by accident. from a bluff, i watched the massive natives consume them bit by gruesome bit while their dying screams echoed in my helmet.

still trying to ground myself in reality, so i can stop thinking that i'm going to miss takeoff :|
