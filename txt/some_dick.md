last night, selena and i were holding hands and walking on a sidewalk. we cross a parking lot, where a car is exiting. the driver pokes his head out. "y'all girls should split them hands and make room for a man" we ignore it. as the car exits the parking lot, the driver says: "make room for some dick" then, as he's beginning to drive away, just: "some dick" i had to stop walking because i was laughing so hard. there was no action associated with his statements. he just wanted to remind some queer kids that, hey, some dick
