Sixth grade involved sex ed. Mr. Clancy took the boys into one room and Mrs. Stevenson took the girls into another. Mr. Clancy set up the projector and put on a reel from before he was born.

"Hello," it declared, "And welcome to an exciting time in your life."

A boy in slacks and hair slicked back appeared on-screen.

"Hello, Tommy! Say hello."

He waved.

"Tommy is becoming a man, and has begun puberty. His body will begin to change in ways that may feel scary or overwhelming, but don't worry. You're entering manhood!"

Tommy's face lit up. Apparently manhood sounded like a swell idea.

"Tommy may develop acne," Tommy grew zits, "And his voice may change," Tommy opened his mouth to speak but could only emit the sound of a tuba. "He'll start thinking about Jessica differently." A girl walked by, and Tommy mouthed *yowza*. "He may even grow facial hair!" Tommy developed a hairy upper lip, which blossomed into a full beard, and fell off.

"At night, Tommy's body may hurt from all these changes. His back will ache as he grows taller, and his shoulders and legs may burn with pain. This is normal! You're just entering manhood." Tommy lay in bed, writhing.

"Tommy's nether parts may start to feel funny. Funny good, sometimes, and sometimes funny bad. An existential dread comes over him as he lies awake, feeling ashamed of his body. He wonders, is this manhood? Yes, Tommy! Angst and anger and self-loathing are all part of the puzzle. Your body is hauling you into a new part of your life, kicking and screaming the whole way. You may delight in what meager breast growth this hormonal maelstrom grants you, but hope never lasts! That growth will recede just like your hairline in due time. Accept your body as a prison and smile through your teeth as you beg for death."

Then I woke up. The movie was over. Mr. Clancy began disassembling the projector and asked, "Any questions?"
