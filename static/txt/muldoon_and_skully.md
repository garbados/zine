mulder and scully cross over into an alternate timeline while chasing a suspect, only to come across uncanny strangers: foxy muldoon, a foxy FBI eccentric; and skully, a floating skull. they decide to team up when foxy says "the pieces aren't adding up" but mulder knows she means "aliens" while skully and scully pioneer cryptoforensics and gossip about cuties. finally caught, the villain melts into cotton candy, and both timelines' skinners are forced to read a 27-page report about time travelling murder-wizards and the magic of friendship.
