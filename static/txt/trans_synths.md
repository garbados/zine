as i keep playing fallout, i like its writing more and more. maybe because its central conflict mirrors shit trans people go through

fallout 4 includes "synths" or "synthetic humans" which are indistinguishable from humans, minus a "synth component" you can haul out of their organs post-mortem. various groups in the game feel very strongly about synths, including a) they should be our slaves b) they should be destroyed c) they're people and deserve rights

an NPC in the (c) camp remarks "i bet you'd never met a synth before meeting [other NPC]" which is a thing cis people have said to other cis people about me. how would i know who was a synth? for all intents and purposes, they're human.

even the folks who want synths free still think of them as strange and other. in camps (a) and (b), fallout's characters philosophize synths until they're no longer living, breathing, feeling beings, just curiosities and anathema. like ted cruz accusing a mass shooter of being a ["transgendered leftist activist"][zodiac] characters that want synths dead think of them more like a disease than like people. characters that want synths enslaved sometimes remind me of fetishists who don't bother with whether or not we're people, because we only exist to advance their selfish fantasies. the synths that obey their slavers have rationalized the power granted by their loyalty, and demonstrate understandable concerns about biting the hand that feeds.

i don't mean that trans people are like synths because gender is fake or whatever. characters in the game treat synths much like cis people treat trans people. synths working to help other synths display babytran/eldertran structures i observe in our community. one synth remarks, "my safehouse kiddies need me to make some booms" in a voice and cadence i have heard from sisters looking out for each other. the presence of KLE0 as a transmisogynistic joke leads me to believe fallout's writers don't know any trans people, and so the resemblance of synths to trans people is probably a coincidence. but as a trans person, idk, it turns much of the shitty writing into poignant displays of privilege and prejudice. and it makes blowing up the prydwyn that much more satisfying :D
