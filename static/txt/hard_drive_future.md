amber introduced me to folks carrying hard drives with them in post-apoc settings. civilization ends by whatever means, so you pack up your survival gear plus your laptop plus your 5tb ssd so that when the lightning dragons are out scorching the world's remains, you can cozy up in your cave, plug your compy into your hand-crank generator, and watch ghost in the shell for the millionth time, along with every other movie you pirated before the internet ceased to exist

two gens down and your post-gender grandbabby lugs around a 1pb ssd that they got in a burned out best buy, filled with backups of backups of backups of every fucking hard drive they've ever encountered. they consult the file directory for guidance. looking at the stars, they whisper:

"advice dog teaches us that when life orders you pizza, it sometimes pays in snakes"
