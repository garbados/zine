fuckboy looking at pictures of trans women, giggles "it's a trap!" it's a trap alright. you're trapped between your feelings and your training. those decades you spent learning disgust but you still think about how her eyes sparkle in the pictures. you search your masculinity for compassion and love but you find only fear and arousal and a self-hatred you never learned to name. "it's a trap" you say again. you wonder if you'll ever escape.
