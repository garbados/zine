last night i wrote a patch for a project i use, degendering their docs. the project’s bugtracker admin told me singular “they” is grating to them, and that nonbinary people don’t mind being excluded through gendered language. it was baffling.
later, others appeared and merged my code. the bugtracker admin had never mattered to the outcome, but he still felt at ease speaking for people he didn’t even consider real prior to my saying, “i’m nonbinary. this matters to me.”

even if my code got accepted, it was still fucking exhausting to barrel through assholes to get it done.
