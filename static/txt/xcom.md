in xcom you play as the conspiracy mulder always wanted to uncover. backed by a global shadow government called "the council" you and your team combat invaders from another world. this existential threat to humanity warrants a limited budget and a "gray market" where you sell alien artifacts and alien corpses to governments and corporations.

the game plays like several complex boardgames strapped together with remarkably buggy graphics. i got it for free under circumstances i cant remember. it's a... manners piece, the encapsulation of a particular culture in a particular time. extraterrestrials fit perfectly into USian narratives about terrorism, while troops that speak american english regardless of origin play world police. your "scientists" amount to professional torturers, and your head of engineering delights in xenophobic speculation about the motives of a society he has only ever worked to destroy.

what gets me most tho is that, by the game's end, you discover that the aliens represent a coalition of psychic species seeking out other ESP-capable lifeforms. they've scoured much of the galaxy for others like themselves, but for some reason, they prefer to indulge USian paranoia with terrorist attacks and abductions, instead of divulging their intentions upon first contact. they have the power to obliterate the planet but somehow conventional weapons are enough to fight back successfully, because their goals never included violence. the doublespeak involved in producing a narrative that both justifies and parodies military responses to terrorism boggles my mind. gj firaxis you fucking did it

tl;dr it's a game about world police vs space daesh, but mechanically it's pretty great? idk. still playing
