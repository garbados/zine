# why is this

idk

i'm some sad witch who daydreams about boobs and ways to end the world

of course i'd write dystopic microfiction, mostly ported from my facebook, in the form of a website, using tech closely associated with personal trauma

maybe i'll do more of these. producing this website helped me to process a lot of shitty feelings from the past few years. i wanted its code to be just as much a part of the work as any of the text posts it displays. so, idk, read the source
