been playing borderlands 2 to relieve stress. i know it's an overwrought murderfest sim, but so

the narrative plunges you into a late-capitalist hell projected into a future where not even death gets you out. enterprising corporations litter war-torn planets with machines that regenerate your body upon expiration, for a fee you can't not pay. money is plentiful, but useless to secure a different future. gambling offers the best return you can get.

everyone you meet and/or kill is locked in their own personal hell, just like you. conglomerates transported miners, accountants, engineers, and their families to the planet by the billions, and left them there when operations became unprofitable. every bandit is just another immortal wage slave, just like you.

the intelligent machines replacing human workers learn to suffer as a reward. sentience is doled out bit by bit in return for unerring slaughter. "any loader able to kill a thresher will be rewarded with the ability to feel proud of having killed a thresher"

the game explores the profitability of suffering itself, and depicts capitalism as a machine that, even once mechanized and automated, still exists only to replicate pain.
