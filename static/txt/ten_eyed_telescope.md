i've been spending my nights dreaming about another world

a ten-eyed creature sits in orbit, dangling tentacles into an atmosphere rich in nutrients. a secretion encases it, protecting it from the vacuum of space, and acting like lenses over its eyes. for centuries, it has peered into space.

it sings its findings into the biosphere, transmitting its entire neural state as a frequency of vibrations. it hears the songs of others like itself, and others with other forms all over the planet. they take every shape, crafting themselves through intentional metamorphosis as they see fit. cocoons dot the planet's surface, holding children who dream their bodies into existence.

they are clones of elder things, cuttings from branches and ejected limbs. someday, our ten-eyed telescope will drop a tentacle to the ground, where it will dream a life all its own, and join the planetsong with its own voice.

i spend my nights dreaming with them :3
